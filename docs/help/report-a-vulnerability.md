Reporting a vulnerability 
=========================

If you have spotted a vulnerability in Privcy, please make sure to let me know immediately. I take any report very seriously and will react as soon as possible. Please write to me directy at [contact@smn.codes](mailto:contact@smn.codes).

Please do not write to me publicly, e.g. in an issue, as making security vulnerabilities public before they are fixed can give attackers valuable time to exploit the issue.
